# Assistant

Me Trying to learn flutter, Don't bully me.
Saving progress in github so that I don't lose them if my pc messed up.
Making it public so that I dont need to login to download this (ft.Nobody cares)

## What does it have till now:
- A CRUD app
- NavBar

## Note:
- too bad performance
- unwanted pages stacking up
- Database struct is a mess
- No loading screen

## TODO
- Change routing on the whole (named routes suck)
